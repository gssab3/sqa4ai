Introduction

Cryptographic key management is a crucial element of cryptographic system security. This cheat sheet provides guidelines on how to securely generate, store, distribute, rotate, and revoke keys, minimizing the risk of compromise.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Insecure key storage (e.g., hardcoding or storing in plaintext).

    Lack of periodic cryptographic key rotation.

    Insecure key distribution to endpoints.

    Lack of control and auditing of key use.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use secure hardware modules (HSMs) or dedicated systems for key storage.

    Implement regular key rotation and lifecycle management policies.

    Use secure key distribution protocols (e.g., TLS).

    Maintain strict access control and logs of key operations.

    Separate roles and responsibilities for key management (separation of duties principle).

    Automate key management where possible to reduce human error.
