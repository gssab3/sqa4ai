Introduction

Threat modeling is a systematic process aimed at identifying, understanding, and managing security threats to an application or system from the early design stages. It helps prevent vulnerabilities by reducing the attack surface and anticipating potential risks.

What to do / Risk causes

    Failure to identify potential threats during design.

    Failure to consider all system components and interactions, including external dependencies.

    Poor understanding of the context of use and attacker motivations.

    Lack of a process for continuously updating the model following changes.

Solutions and prevention

    Use structured methods such as STRIDE, PASTA, or Attack Trees to classify threats.

    Clearly define assets, actors, data flows, and entry points.

    Engage multidisciplinary teams to gain a comprehensive view of vulnerabilities.

    Update the model regularly as the system and threat context evolve.

    Prioritize threats based on risk (impact and likelihood) to guide mitigation efforts.
