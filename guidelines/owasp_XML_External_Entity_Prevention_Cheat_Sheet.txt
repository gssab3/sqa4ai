Introduction

The XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability involves the improper use of external entities in XML documents, which can lead to sensitive data exposure, denial of service, or unauthorized access to internal resources.

What to do / Risk factors

    XML parsers configured to allow the expansion of external entities.

    Use of XML from untrusted sources without adequate security measures.

    Lack of filters and restrictions on XML input.

    Incorrect configurations that allow access to local files or internal services via XXE.

Solutions and prevention

    Disable external entity expansion in XML parsers.

    Use secure and up-to-date XML parsers.

    Validate and sanitize all incoming XML data.

    Enforce size limits on XML documents to prevent denial of service.

    Monitor and log XML requests to identify suspicious activity.
