Introduction

Prototype pollution is a common vulnerability in JavaScript environments, where an attacker can manipulate the __proto__ property or other prototype properties to alter the behavior of global or specific objects, causing unexpected and potentially dangerous effects.

Causes

    Lack of validation on input that modifies object properties, especially those reserved for the prototype.

    Use of libraries or code that allows direct modifications to prototypes without restrictions.

    Passing unsafe data from external inputs without sanitization.

Solutions and Prevention

    Rigorously validate and filter inputs before using them in object modification operations.

    Avoid directly assigning or reading __proto__, constructor.prototype, or similar properties.

    Use updated libraries that automatically prevent prototype pollution.

    Apply safe programming principles to isolate data and prevent unwanted global modifications.

    Conduct specific security tests for prototype pollution.
