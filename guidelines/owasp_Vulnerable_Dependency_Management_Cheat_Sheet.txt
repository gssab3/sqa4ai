Introduction

Vulnerable dependency management involves identifying, updating, and monitoring third-party libraries and components used in an application to prevent the introduction of known vulnerabilities through external software.

What to do / Risk factors

    Use of obsolete or outdated libraries containing known vulnerabilities.

    Unmonitored transitively vulnerable dependencies.

    Lack of automated processes for version control and updates.

    Incorporation of untrusted or unverified components.

Solutions and prevention

    Adopt automated tools for dependency monitoring and vulnerability scanning (e.g., SCA - Software Composition Analysis).

    Keep all libraries and frameworks updated with the latest security patches.

    Evaluate and approve each dependency before use in production.

    Minimize the number of external dependencies to reduce the attack surface.

    Establish dependency lifecycle management policies.
