Introduction

Input validation is the fundamental process for ensuring that user-supplied data is correct, complete, and secure before being processed by the system. A robust validation strategy helps prevent numerous types of vulnerabilities, including injection, XSS, and application logic issues.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Lack of or insufficient verification of input data.

    Client-side validation only, easily circumvented.

    Incorrect assumptions about data formats or boundaries.

    Allowing data with dangerous characters or unexpected input.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement server-side validation as the primary line of defense.

    Use whitelists to define exactly what is acceptable (e.g., format, length, type).

    Avoid blacklists, which are often incomplete.

    Validate and sanitize all data from external sources, including APIs and files.

    Robustly handle validation errors, preventing information leaks.
