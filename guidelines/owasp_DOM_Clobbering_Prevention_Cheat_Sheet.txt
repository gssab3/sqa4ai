Introduction

DOM Clobbering is an attack in which an attacker exploits the overriding of DOM properties or methods, typically through HTML elements with names or IDs that override JavaScript variables or critical functions, causing unexpected behavior or XSS vulnerabilities. It is an often overlooked problem, but it can compromise the security of web applications by manipulating the DOM model at the scripting level.

Typical Causes

    Using HTML elements with names, IDs, or attributes that collide with JavaScript variables or functions.

    Incorrect assumption that global variable names are not overridden by DOM elements.

    Lack of isolation or secure scoping for JavaScript code on the front end.

    Direct access to global properties without checks or namespaces.

Solutions and Prevention

    Avoid using names, IDs, or attributes that may conflict with global JavaScript variables or methods.

    Use unique names and naming patterns for DOM elements.

    Encapsulate JavaScript code in modules or namespaces to avoid global conflicts.

    Validate and filter inputs that may control DOM element attributes or names.

    Implement safe development practices for DOM manipulation, avoiding assumptions about global context.

    Test the application for possible DOM property overrides.
