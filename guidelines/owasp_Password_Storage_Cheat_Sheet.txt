Introduction

Secure password management is essential for protecting user access. Storing passwords securely helps prevent compromise in the event of a data breach.

Causes

    Storing passwords in clear text or with weak hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1 without salt).

    Lack of salt or use of static or predictable salts.

    Reuse of outdated or undesigned hashing methods for passwords (e.g., generic hashes).

    Accidental exposure of files containing passwords.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use password-specific hashing algorithms, such as Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2, with appropriate cost parameters.

    Apply a unique, random salt to each password.

    Never store passwords in clear text or with reversible passwords.

    Implement control and protection mechanisms against brute force attempts (rate limiting, lockout).

    Ensure the security of infrastructure and access to password databases.
