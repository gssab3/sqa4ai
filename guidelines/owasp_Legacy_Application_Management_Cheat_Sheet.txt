Introduction

Legacy applications often pose a security risk due to outdated technologies, lack of updates, and incompatibility with modern practices. This cheat sheet offers strategies to manage and mitigate the risks associated with legacy applications during maintenance or migration.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Use of outdated and vulnerable libraries and frameworks.

    Lack of security patches and updates.

    Undocumented or unclear code that makes maintenance difficult.

    Difficulty integrating with new security systems.

    Lack of modern authentication and authorization controls.

Remediation and Prevention

    Conduct a comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessment of the legacy application.

    Apply security patches and updates where possible.

    Isolate the legacy application in secure networks or environments.

    Plan the migration to more modern and secure solutions.

    Implement additional security controls at the network or proxy level.

    Document and progressively improve code and processes.
