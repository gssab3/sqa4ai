Introduction

Browser extensions are software components that extend the functionality of web browsers. While very useful, they represent a potentially critical attack vector because they have access to sensitive user data, can manipulate web page content, and interact with other system resources. Extension security is essential to protect user privacy and security and prevent abuse, such as data theft, malicious code execution, or phishing attacks.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Excessive or overly generous permissions granted to extensions, exposing sensitive data or functions.

    Lack of control over the origin and integrity of extension code (malicious or compromised code).

    Vulnerabilities in the communication mechanisms between the extension and the web page or backend servers (e.g., man-in-the-middle, injection).

    Improper use of critical APIs, which can lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

    Mishandling of sensitive data, such as credentials or session tokens, stored or transmitted without protection.

    Lack of secure update mechanisms, leaving extensions vulnerable for a long time.

    Poor validation of input from web pages or users, exposing them to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other vulnerabilities.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Limit extension permissions to the bare minimum required for the required functionality.

    Conduct rigorous code review and use digital signatures to ensure software integrity.

    Protect communications using secure protocols (HTTPS, secure message passing).

    Use secure APIs and follow best practices for permission management.

    Appropriately encrypt and protect sensitive data, avoiding storing it in clear text.

    Implement automatic, signed updates to promptly fix vulnerabilities.

    Always validate and sanitize input from web pages or users to prevent XSS and injection attacks.

    Clearly inform users about the permissions required by the extension and justify their use.
