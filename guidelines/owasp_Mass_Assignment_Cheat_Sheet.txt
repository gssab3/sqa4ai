Introduction

Mass Assignment is a vulnerability that occurs when an application allows data from user input to be directly assigned to models or objects without adequate filtering, potentially allowing unauthorized modifications of sensitive or confidential fields.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Automatically binding user input to objects without whitelisting or blacklisting mutable fields.

    Lack of code-level checks to differentiate mutable data from sensitive data.

    Incorrect assumption that the frontend controls which data is sent.

Resolve and Prevent

    Use whitelists to explicitly specify which fields can be assigned from external inputs.

    Implement business logic-level checks to validate data changes.

    Limit the data the frontend can send and also validate it on the server side.

    Use frameworks or libraries that support secure, controlled assignment mechanisms.

    Conduct security tests to identify potential mass assignments.
