Introduction

Authentication is the process by which a system verifies the identity of a user or system before granting access. Strong authentication is essential to protect sensitive resources and prevent unauthorized access, which could compromise security and privacy. Authentication techniques include the use of passwords, tokens, digital certificates, and biometric methods. It is also important to consider the interaction with session management and authorization.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Weak or easily guessable passwords, with no complexity or expiration policy, which facilitate brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.

    Lack of credential protection during transmission (lack of HTTPS) or storage (passwords stored in clear text or with insecure hashing such as MD5 or SHA1).

    Lack or poor implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which exposes the system to compromise with a single factor (e.g., password).

    Session management vulnerabilities, such as session fixation, session hijacking, or lack of automatic session expiration.

    Insecure password recovery mechanisms, such as resets using easily guessable questions or untimed links.

    Untested custom implementations, which can introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors or bypasses).

    Lack of monitoring and logging of authentication events, which reduces the ability to detect ongoing attacks.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Enforce strong password policies, requiring minimum length, complexity (special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters), and password change frequency, balancing usability and security.

    Protect credentials with robust hashing and salting, using modern algorithms such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 to store passwords securely.

    Force the use of HTTPS/TLS for authentication data transmission, preventing interception (MITM).

    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), preferably combining something the user knows (password) with something they have (OTP token) or are (biometrics).

    Limit login attempts with temporary lock mechanisms or CAPTCHAs to mitigate brute force attacks.

    Securely manage sessions, with automatic timeouts, invalidation after logout, regeneration of the session ID after login, and protection from fixation/hijacking.

    Implement secure password recovery and reset procedures, with timed links, identity verification, and monitoring of suspicious activity.

    Log and monitor authentication events to detect and quickly respond to suspicious attempts or anomalies.

    Regularly test the security of the authentication system, including through penetration testing and code review.
