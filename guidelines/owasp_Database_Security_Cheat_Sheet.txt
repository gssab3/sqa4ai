Introduction

This cheat sheet outlines security practices for protecting databases and stored data, preventing unauthorized access, loss, or compromise. It covers both configuration and operational management aspects.

Typical Problems / Causes

    Weak or shared credentials across multiple services.

    Lack of encryption for data at rest or in transit.

    Insecure default configurations (exposed ports, default users, excessive permissions).

    Lack of activity monitoring and logging.

    Queries vulnerable to SQL injection.

What to do / How to prevent

    Use strong authentication and secure credential management.

    Enable encryption at rest (TDE, column encryption) and TLS for client-server connections.

    Restrict privileges following the principle of least privilege.

    Disable or remove unnecessary accounts and services.

    Implement controls against SQL injection (prepared statements, parameterized queries).

    Enable logging and auditing to monitor access and changes.

    Keep the DBMS up to date and apply security patches promptly.
