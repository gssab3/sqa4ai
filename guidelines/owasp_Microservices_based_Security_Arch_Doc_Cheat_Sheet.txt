Introduction

This document provides guidelines and best practices for designing and implementing secure microservices architectures. Microservices, as autonomous and distributed components, present unique security challenges, such as managing communications, authentication and authorization, and protecting data in motion and at rest.

Typical Challenges

    Expanded attack surface due to the multiplicity of services and interactions between them.

    Difficulty in centrally managing identities and authorizations.

    Potentially insecure inter-service communications (e.g., man-in-the-middle).

    Complex management of sensitive data and its protection in distributed environments.

    Difficulty in monitoring and tracking security events in a fragmented system.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement a secure API gateway to inspect and filter all external requests.

    Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for interactions between microservices.

    Implement a centralized authentication and authorization system (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).

    Adopt the principle of least privilege for each microservice.

    Implement centralized logging and continuous monitoring of security activities.

    Use encryption techniques for sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

    Conduct regular attack surface analysis and update defenses.
