Introduction

HTML5 introduces new features for the modern web, improving the user experience, but it also brings new security risks if not managed properly. It is essential to understand how new HTML5 APIs and technologies can be exploited by attackers to compromise application security.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Improper use of HTML5 APIs such as localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB, which can expose sensitive data if not properly protected.

    Lack of control over the origin of data loaded via Web Workers, WebSockets, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), facilitating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

    Vulnerabilities related to multimedia, geolocation, and notifications, which can be exploited to obtain user information or perform unauthorized actions.

    Insufficient validation and sanitization of user input via new HTML5 inputs.

Solutions and Prevention

    Limit the use of client-side storage to non-sensitive data and implement encryption where necessary.

    Enforce restrictive CORS policies and always validate the origins of external requests.

    Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce XSS risks.

    Validate and sanitize all data from HTML5 inputs, including those from new input types and APIs.

    Carefully manage permissions for sensitive APIs such as geolocation and notifications, always requiring explicit user consent.

    Continuously monitor and update libraries and frameworks to avoid known vulnerabilities.
