Introduction

Credential stuffing is an automated attack in which an attacker uses usernames and passwords leaked from a breach to attempt to log in to other systems. It differs from a brute-force attack because it uses already valid credential pairs, often due to the common practice of reusing passwords across multiple sites. The OWASP guide also offers effective defenses against password spraying or brute-force attacks, making authentication processes more resilient.

Typical Issues / Causes

    Credential reuse: Many users use the same username/password across multiple sites, making it easier to log in via an attack with compromised credentials.

    Lack of or inadequate implementation of MFA, the most effective measure according to Microsoft for preventing compromised accounts.

    Advanced bot automation: Attackers exploit proxies and distributed networks to bypass rate-limiting or IP blocking.

    Lack of monitoring and response to suspicious events, especially anomalous login attempts.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially for suspicious or privileged logins—this is the primary defense.

    Defense in depth with alternative techniques:
        Require PINs, secondary passwords, or security questions as an additional layer (not MFA, but useful if necessary).
        Use CAPTCHAs on suspicious attempts, such as after several failures or from dubious sources.
        Apply IP-based mitigations such as throttling or the use of IP intelligence (e.g., known proxies).

    Implement device and connection fingerprinting to validate context and detect automated approaches.

    Require unpredictable usernames, reducing the effectiveness of automatic dictionaries.

    Adopt multi-step logins (e.g., sequential commands or extra tokens) to complicate automation.

    Promote advanced preventative strategies:
        Implement degradation (slow rendering, large files, random errors) to slow down automated attacks.
        Verify whether used passwords have been compromised (e.g., via Pwned Passwords database) and prevent their use.
        Alert users about anomalous activity, but avoid overloading them with too many notifications.

Monitoring and metrics:

    Every defense should produce metrics (login_attempts, captcha_rate, blocked_ips, etc.) to identify failures or new attacks.

    Coordinate teams when modifying automated defenses to avoid inconsistencies.
