Introduction

Integrating third-party JavaScript is common in web applications, but it introduces significant security risks, such as malicious code injection, data leakage, and privacy compromise.

Causes

    Inclusion of unverified or compromised libraries or scripts.

    Failure to segregate third-party code from internal code.

    Excessive permissions granted to external scripts.

Solutions and Prevention

    Evaluate and select only trusted, actively maintained scripts.

    Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit allowed script sources.

    Load scripts from secure CDNs with Subresource Integrity (SRI) integration.

    Isolate third-party scripts in iframes or sandboxes to limit their impact.

    Regularly monitor the security of the libraries used.

    Avoid using eval() or other dangerous functions that execute dynamic code.
