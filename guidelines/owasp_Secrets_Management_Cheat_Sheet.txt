Introduction

Secrets management refers to the secure process of creating, storing, distributing, and rotating sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, certificates, tokens, and other confidential data used by applications. Proper management is essential to reduce the risk of system compromise and ensure the confidentiality of credentials.

Causes

    Storing secrets in plaintext within source code or unprotected configuration files.

    Insecure sharing of secrets between teams or systems, for example, via email or public repositories.

    Failure to regularly rotate secrets, increasing the window of exposure in the event of a compromise.

    Lack of strict access controls over where and how secrets are stored and used.

    Poor traceability and monitoring of secret access.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use dedicated secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and distribute secrets.

    Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or in public repositories.

    Enforce automatic and periodic rotation of credentials and keys.

    Implement access controls based on the principle of least privilege.

    Enable auditing and logging to track access and changes to secrets.

    Always encrypt secrets both at rest and in transit.

    Integrate secret management into the deployment process and CI/CD pipelines to reduce human errors.
