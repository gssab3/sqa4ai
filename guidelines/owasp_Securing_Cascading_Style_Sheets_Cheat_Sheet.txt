Introduction

CSS security is concerned with preventing attacks related to the malicious or improper use of styles, such as visual manipulation, information leakage, or techniques to circumvent client-side security controls.

Causes

    Use of unfiltered CSS or CSS injected from untrusted sources.

    Style manipulations that can hide critical content or elements.

    Ability to exploit CSS techniques to exfiltrate data or track users.

Solutions and Prevention

    Validate and sanitize inputs that can influence CSS.

    Limit and control the sources from which styles are loaded (Content Security Policy).

    Avoid the use of inline styles with unverified dynamic data.

    Monitor and limit the use of potentially abusive CSS techniques such as animations or pseudo-elements.

    Integrate CSS security into the front-end development process to reduce visual and manipulation risks.
