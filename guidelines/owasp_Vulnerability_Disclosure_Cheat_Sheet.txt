Introduction

Vulnerability disclosure is the organized and responsible process of receiving, managing, and communicating information about security vulnerabilities to facilitate their rapid resolution and mitigate risks.

What to do / Risk causes

    Lack of clear channels for reporting vulnerabilities.

    Uncontrolled dissemination of information that can facilitate attacks.

    Delays in remediation that increase user risk.

    Poor communication between security researchers and development teams.

Solutions and prevention

    Establish clear disclosure policies, including dedicated communication channels (e.g., bug bounty, email).

    Define response and remediation times and methods (coordinated vulnerability disclosure).

    Transparently communicate security updates to end users.

    Encourage collaboration with the security community to improve the timeliness and quality of fixes.

    Document and periodically review disclosure policies to adapt to developments.
