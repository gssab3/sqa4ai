Introduction

Query parameterization is a fundamental technique for preventing injection vulnerabilities, particularly SQL injection, by ensuring that user-supplied data is not interpreted as code.

Causes

    Building SQL queries by directly concatenating user input without filtering.

    Failure to separate data from code in queries.

    Failure to use secure parameterization APIs or ORMs.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the language or database.

    Avoid direct string concatenation to build queries.

    Validate and sanitize inputs, even if parameterized.

    Apply the principle of least privilege to database access.

    Use ORMs or data access libraries that facilitate automatic parameterization.
