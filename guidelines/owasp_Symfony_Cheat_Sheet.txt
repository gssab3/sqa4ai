Introduction

Symfony is a popular PHP framework for developing robust and scalable web applications. Security in Symfony relies on built-in features to manage authentication, authorization, validation, and protection from common vulnerabilities.

    Manage authentication and authorization with the Security component.

    CSRF protection for forms and HTTP requests.

    Validate and sanitize input using the Validator and Form components.

    Protect against vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, and Session Fixation.

Solutions and Prevention

    Configure the firewall and access rules using the Security Bundle.

    Use CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.

    Validate input rigorously with Symfony Validator constraints.

    Update Symfony and its dependencies regularly to maintain security.

    Set up session and cookie management correctly (HttpOnly, Secure).
