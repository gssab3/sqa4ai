Introduction

Web services security concerns the protection of APIs and services exposed over the network, which are often critical communication and data vectors between distributed systems.

What to do / Risk factors

    Lack of adequate authentication and authorization on APIs.

    Unencrypted communications that expose sensitive data.

    Unvalidated input that can lead to injection or other attacks.

    Excessive exposure of unnecessary endpoints or functionality.

    Inadequate error handling that can reveal sensitive information.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement strong authentication and granular authorization on APIs.

    Use HTTPS for all communications between clients and web services.

    Rigorously validate all incoming data.

    Limit endpoint exposure to only those strictly necessary.

    Handle errors securely without exposing internal information.

    Apply rate limiting and monitoring to prevent abuse.
