Introduction

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack in which an attacker tricks a vulnerable server into making HTTP requests to internal or external resources to which it would not normally have access. This type of attack exploits the server's role as an intermediary, potentially bypassing firewalls or access controls.

Causes

    Failure to validate or sanitize inputs that define URLs or resources to be contacted.

    Lack of restrictions on the destinations of requests made by the server.

    Misconfigurations that allow access to unprotected internal resources.

Solutions and Prevention

    Rigorously validate and filter inputs that define addresses or URLs to be called.

    Restrict outgoing requests to a whitelist of known and trusted domains or IP addresses.

    Implement network controls to block requests to sensitive internal addresses (e.g., localhost, metadata service).

    Use authentication and authorization mechanisms for server-side requests as well.

    Monitor and log all external requests to detect anomalous behavior.
