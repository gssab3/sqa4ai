Introduction

Authorization is the process of determining the permissions of a user or entity within a system after their identity has been authenticated. It ensures that users can access only the resources and actions for which they have the appropriate rights, preventing unauthorized access that could compromise the security or confidentiality of data. An effective authorization system is essential to maintaining the principle of least privilege and protecting critical resources.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Insufficient or missing access controls, allowing users to access unauthorized resources or functionality.

    Authorization controls applied inconsistently or only on the client, easily circumvented.

    Incorrect use or lack of separation between authentication and authorization.

    Overly permissive or poorly defined roles, assigning more privileges than necessary.

    Lack of dynamic authorization validation for critical operations, with hard-coded or static permissions.

    Lack of access logging and monitoring, which prevents detection of abuse or unauthorized access.

    Known vulnerabilities such as Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A01) exist in the system.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Always apply authorization controls on the server, never just the client.

    Implement a well-defined and updated role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), or policy-based access control model.

    Clearly separate authentication from authorization processes.

    Verify authorizations for every request and critical action, with dynamic validations.

    Minimize privileges assigned to users, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

    Integrate detailed logging and access monitoring to identify and respond to potential abuse.

    Perform regular reviews and audits of assigned permissions and roles.

    Use automated and manual testing to detect authorization issues, including fuzzing and targeted pen testing.
