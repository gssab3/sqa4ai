Introduction

Cloud architecture security concerns the protection of infrastructure, platforms, and services distributed across public, private, or hybrid cloud environments. The focus is on how to design, implement, and manage cloud resources to mitigate risks specific to these environments, while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Causes

    Misconfigurations or improper permission management of cloud resources.

    Lack of visibility or control over access to and use of distributed resources.

    Insufficient segmentation and isolation between components and services.

    Lack of centralized monitoring and management of security events.

    Inadvertent exposure of sensitive or secret data.

Solutions and Prevention

    Adopt security principles such as the principle of least privilege and network segmentation.

    Use configuration management and monitoring tools to detect anomalies.

    Encrypt data in transit and at rest, including in cloud resources.

    Integrate automation and infrastructure as code to enforce consistent security policies.

    Implement strong authentication and secure identity management (IAM) mechanisms.

    Conduct regular audits and penetration tests specific to cloud environments.
