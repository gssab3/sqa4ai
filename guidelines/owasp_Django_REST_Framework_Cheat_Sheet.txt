Introduction

This cheat sheet focuses on security best practices for applications based on the Django REST Framework (DRF), a popular toolkit for building REST APIs in Django. The goal is to protect APIs from common attacks and vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data exposed via APIs.

Typical Issues / Causes

    Lack of adequate authentication and authorization on API endpoints.

    Overly permissive or misconfigured permissions that expose sensitive data or functions.

    Lack of input data validation, which can lead to malicious code injection or execution.

    Exposure of sensitive information in responses or error messages.

    Misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which can allow requests from untrusted origins.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Implement robust authentication (token, OAuth, JWT) and granular authorization mechanisms.

    Use role-based permissions and limit access to sensitive endpoints.

    Thoroughly validate all incoming data with Django REST serializers and fields.

    Properly configure CORS and limit authorized origins.

    Hide or restrict sensitive information in error messages.

    Apply logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect suspicious activity.
