Microservices Security Cheat Sheet
Introduction

This cheat sheet focuses on the practical aspects of microservice security, covering common issues, vulnerabilities, and the best strategies for protecting them throughout their lifecycle.

Typical causes and risks

    Credential configuration and management errors.

    Insufficient isolation between microservices, allowing privilege escalation.

    Vulnerabilities related to authentication and token management.

    Lack of validation and sanitization of input between services.

    Problems managing resilience and protecting against denial-of-service.

Solutions and prevention

    Apply a "zero trust" security policy for all communication and access.

    Isolate microservices with containers and configure service-level firewalls.

    Manage credentials and secrets with dedicated tools (e.g., Vault).

    Rigorously validate all incoming data and adopt measures against injection and XSS.

    Set rate limits and fallback mechanisms to resist DoS.

    Perform regular security tests, including microservice-specific penetration tests.

    Automate security in the CI/CD process to ensure consistent policies.
