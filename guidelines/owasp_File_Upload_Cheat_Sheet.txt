Introduction

File upload capabilities represent a critical attack surface, often exploited to execute malicious code, overload the system, or gain unauthorized access. Secure upload management is essential to avoid vulnerabilities.

Typical causes of vulnerabilities

    Failure to validate or filter uploaded files (e.g., file types, sizes).

    Incorrect permissions on uploaded folders or files, allowing unwanted access.

    Execution of malicious code through file uploads (e.g., upload scripts).

    Lack of control over the size or frequency of uploaded files, risking denial of service.

Solutions and Prevention

    Limit accepted file types and validate content (not just extensions).

    Set restrictive read and write permissions on upload folders.

    Store uploaded files in isolated, non-executable locations.

    Apply controls on the maximum size and frequency of uploads.

    Use antivirus scans and verification tools for uploaded files.

    Implement authentication and authorization for access to upload features.
