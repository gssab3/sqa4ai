Introduction

Unvalidated redirects and forwards are vulnerabilities in which a web application redirects or forwards a user to an unchecked or unvalidated destination, allowing phishing, malware, or information theft attacks.

What to do / Risk factors

    Unchecked user input that defines destination URLs for redirects or forwards.

    Failure to verify or sanitize the destination URL.

    Use of open redirects that can be exploited to direct victims to malicious sites.

    Application design that does not clearly distinguish authorized destinations.

Solutions and prevention

    Always validate redirect and forward URLs, accepting only internal or default destinations.

    Implement whitelists of safe URLs or domains.

    Avoid the direct use of user input as an unchecked destination.

    Provide the user with clear messages and the ability to confirm before external redirects.

    Monitor and log redirects to detect abuse.
