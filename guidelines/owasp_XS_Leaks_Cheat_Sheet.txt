Introduction

XS Leaks (Cross-Site Leaks) are techniques that exploit differences in browser or server behavior to obtain sensitive information through side channels, bypassing traditional security measures such as the Same-Origin Policy.

What to Do / Risk Causes

    Information inferred from differences in response times or error content.

    Use techniques such as CSRF, misconfigured CORS, or cache poisoning.

    Lack of specific protections against side channels.

Solutions and Prevention

    Enforce strict CORS policies.

    Prevent information disclosure through error messages or timing.

    Use randomization techniques and mitigations to reduce side channels.

    Monitor for anomalous traffic behavior and responses.
