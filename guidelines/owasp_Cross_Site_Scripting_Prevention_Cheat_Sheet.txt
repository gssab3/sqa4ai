Introduction

XSS attacks occur when a web application embeds untrusted data (such as user input) into web pages without proper validation or encoding, allowing malicious scripts to execute in the victim's browser. This compromises the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and users. ([turn0search0])

Typical Issues / Causes

    Unvalidated or sanitized input embedded directly in the DOM or HTML markup.

    Use of unescaped variables, making them interpretable as code.

    Frameworks deployed without leveraging automatic protections against XSS, or with gaps in specific contexts (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URLs).

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Apply contextual output encoding, such as HTML entity encoding for content in markup, JS escaping for data inserted in scripts, URL encoding for parameters, CSS escaping in CSS.

    Preferably use frameworks that automate escaping and validation (e.g., React, Angular), but be aware of their limitations.

    Rigorously validate inputs, preventing injection through whitelists and sanity checks.

    Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) as an additional layer of defense to limit the sources of scripts that can be loaded.
