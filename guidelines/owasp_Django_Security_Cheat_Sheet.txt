Introduction

This cheat sheet contains key recommendations for securing web applications developed with Django. It covers various aspects of security, from authentication to session management, from protection against common vulnerabilities to securely configuring the framework itself.

Typical Problems / Causes

    Missing or non-default security configurations (e.g., CSRF, X-Frame-Options).

    Insecure handling of cookies, sessions, and sensitive data.

    Using outdated versions of Django or vulnerable libraries.

    Exposing debugging information and stack traces in production environments.

    Lack of protection against common attacks such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Enable and configure Django's built-in protections: CSRF middleware, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and HSTS.

    Use secure cookies and HTTP Only for sessions and authentication.

    Regularly update Django and all dependencies to fix known vulnerabilities.

    Disable debug mode in production to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

    Validate and sanitize user input, and use the Django ORM for secure queries.

    Enforce robust password management policies, including limiting login attempts.

    Implement logging and monitoring of access and errors.
