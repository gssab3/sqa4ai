Introduction

XSS Filter Evasion describes the techniques attackers use to bypass browser or application anti-XSS filters, allowing malicious scripts to execute despite countermeasures.

What to do / Risk factors

    Misconfigured or insufficient XSS filters.

    Input not fully sanitized.

    Attackers use advanced obfuscation, encoding, and concatenation techniques.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use server- and client-side input validation and sanitization.

    Implement robust Content Security Policies (CSPs).

    Avoid exclusive reliance on browser XSS filters.

    Regularly update filters and security tools.
