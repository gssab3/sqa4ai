Introduction

The SAML Cheat Sheet addresses security in the context of SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), a widely used Single Sign-On (SSO) protocol for federated authentication between identity providers and services. Ensuring SAML security is crucial to preventing identity theft and unauthorized access.

Causes

    Incorrect SAML implementations that allow replay, spoofing, or man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Insufficient management of digital signatures and encryption in SAML assertions.

    Incorrect metadata configurations between identity providers and service providers.

    Failure to verify the audience, timestamp, or validity conditions of assertions.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use digital signatures and encryption to protect assertions and SAML messages.

    Always validate the audience, issuer, timestamp, and validity conditions.

    Properly configure metadata between identity providers and service providers, updating it regularly.

    Secure communication channels using HTTPS/TLS.

    Monitor and log suspicious logins and authentication attempts.

    Follow the implementation best practices specific to the SAML framework or library used.
