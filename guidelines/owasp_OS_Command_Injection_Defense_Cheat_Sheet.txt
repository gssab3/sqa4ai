Introduction

OS Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system via a vulnerable application. This vulnerability occurs when the application passes unsanitized data directly to a command interpreter (shell), allowing malicious code execution.

Causes

    Lack of or insufficient validation and sanitization of user input.

    Direct use of system functions (e.g., exec, system) with unchecked parameters.

    Incorrect assumption that user input is safe.

    Incorrect configuration or excessive privileges for the process executing the commands.

Solutions and Prevention

    Completely avoid invoking system commands with user input; prefer secure APIs or dedicated libraries.

    If necessary, rigorously validate input (whitelist of acceptable values).

    Use functions that do not pass input to the shell (e.g., execve with arrays of parameters).

    Limit the privileges of the process executing the commands.

    Monitor and log activity to detect abuse.
