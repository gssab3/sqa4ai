Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to manage distributed applications in cloud and on-premises environments. Kubernetes security is critical to protecting clusters, nodes, and workloads from unauthorized access, compromise, and misconfiguration. This cheat sheet provides guidelines for managing and reducing the attack surface in Kubernetes.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Overly permissive access configurations to nodes or clusters (e.g., overly broad RBAC).

    Unencrypted communications between cluster components.

    Lack of isolation between containers or namespaces.

    Use of unverified or vulnerable container images.

    Lack of monitoring and logging of security events.

Solutions and Prevention

    Apply the principle of least privilege through RBAC and fine-grained access controls.

    Encrypt internal communications (TLS between API servers and nodes).

    Use network policies to isolate traffic between pods and namespaces.

    Run security scans on container images and use only signed images.

    Implement continuous monitoring and logging of security events.

    Regularly update Kubernetes and its components to fix known vulnerabilities.
