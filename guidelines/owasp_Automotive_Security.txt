Introduction

    Automotive security concerns the protection of electronic systems and software within modern vehicles, which are increasingly connected and complex. These systems include infotainment, engine control, braking, and communications between vehicles and infrastructure. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access, manipulation, and attacks that could compromise the safety, privacy, or operation of the vehicle, protecting passengers, data, and infrastructure.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Large attack surface due to multiple interfaces (wireless, CAN bus, Bluetooth, etc.).

    Lack of adequate authentication and authorization in control and communication systems.

    Vulnerabilities in firmware and embedded software, which are often out of date.

    Lack of encryption or insecure protocols in communications between components.

    Possibility of physical attacks or attacks via unprotected diagnostic interfaces.

    Inadequate management of cryptographic keys and digital certificates.

    Poor control of internal access to systems, facilitating lateral attacks or privilege escalation.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Apply defense-in-depth, including strong authentication and authorization for every component.

    Implement regular, secure firmware updates (OTA) to fix vulnerabilities.

    Use strong encryption for all communications and sensitive data.

    Segment internal vehicle networks to limit the propagation of attacks.

    Physically protect diagnostic and maintenance interfaces.

    Securely manage keys and certificates, with timely rotation and revocation.

    Conduct continuous analysis of the attack surface throughout development and the vehicle lifecycle.

    Integrate automotive-specific security testing into every phase of the development process.
