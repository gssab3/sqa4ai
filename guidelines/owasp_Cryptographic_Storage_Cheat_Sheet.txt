Introduction

This cheat sheet provides guidelines for protecting sensitive data stored by an application using encryption. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and, in some cases, authenticity of the data, reducing the risk of physical or logical compromise of the storage.

Typical Issues / Causes

    Use of obsolete or insecure cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, DES).

    Inadequate key management (hardcoded keys, lack of rotation, insecure storage).

    Lack of protection for sensitive data "at rest" (e.g., PII, passwords, API secrets).

    Custom, unverified cryptographic implementations.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Use modern, robust algorithms (e.g., AES-256 for symmetric encryption, RSA or ECC for asymmetric encryption, SHA-256 or higher for hashing).

    Use salted and stretched hashing functions for passwords (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2).

    Protect encryption keys using HSMs or secure vaults, with periodic rotation.

    Always encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

    Follow established and secure cryptographic libraries and APIs, avoiding custom implementations.
