Introduction

NodeJS Security sheet provides guidelines for writing and managing secure Node.js applications, addressing common vulnerabilities and strategies for preventing attacks.

Causes and Issues

    Unvalidated inputs that can lead to injections or XSS.

    Improper handling of authentication, sessions, and authorizations.

    Use of modules or dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

    Exposure of sensitive data in logs or through unprotected APIs.

    Lack of protection against DoS attacks or resource abuse.

Solutions and Prevention

    Validate and sanitize all incoming data using trusted libraries.

    Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

    Keep all dependencies up to date and remove unnecessary modules.

    Limit the exposure of sensitive data and encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

    Apply rate limiting, caching, and other techniques to mitigate DoS.

    Monitor and log security events to detect anomalies early.
