Zero Trust architecture is a security model that assumes that no entity, internal or external to the corporate network, is trusted by default, and therefore requires continuous identity and authorization verification for every access.

What to do / Risk sources

    Traditional security models based on trusted network perimeters that can be compromised.

    Lack of segmentation and granular access control.

    Lack of continuous activity monitoring.

Solutions and prevention

    Implement strong and continuous authentication, even for internal resources.

    Segment the network and limit access according to the principle of least privilege.

    Continuously monitor and analyze user and device behavior.

    Automate responses to threats and anomalies.
