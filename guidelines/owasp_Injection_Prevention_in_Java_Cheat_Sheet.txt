Introduction

The Java language, widely used for enterprise applications, is vulnerable to various types of injection if proper programming practices are not followed. The goal is to prevent injections in SQL queries, system commands, and other dynamic interactions.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Use of strings concatenated directly with user input in SQL queries or commands.

    Failure to validate or escape input used in reflective methods or dynamic code execution.

    Dependence on libraries or APIs that do not safely handle external input.

Solutions and Prevention

    Prefer the use of PreparedStatements for SQL queries, avoiding string concatenations.

    Use validation and sanitization libraries for all input data.

    Limit and control the use of functions that execute dynamic or reflective code.

    Keep dependencies up to date and use Java-specific static analysis tools.

    Apply access controls and monitoring to detect anomalous activity.
