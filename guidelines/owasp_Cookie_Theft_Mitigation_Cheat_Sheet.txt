Introduction

Session cookie theft can allow an attacker to impersonate a user's session, even if the original authentication is robust (e.g., MFA). This Cheat Sheet provides strategies to detect and mitigate such theft, increasing the security of user sessions.

Issues / Causes

    Cookies may be used by machines or in contexts other than the original ones, indicating possible theft.

    Checks based on attributes that are also used dynamically (IP, User-Agent, time, language) can generate false positives or negatives if interpreted strictly.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Store contextual information (IP, User-Agent, language, date) when creating the session and compare it with each request.

    In case of suspicious context changes, apply measures such as:
        Forced relogin (invalidate the session, require re-authentication).
        CAPTCHA as an alternative verification method, useful in the presence of bots or suspicious but legitimate scenarios.
