Introduction

Software supply chain security concerns protection against threats that can infiltrate components, libraries, tools, and processes used to build, distribute, and maintain software. The goal is to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and security of everything that contributes to software production.

Causes

    Use of vulnerable or compromised third-party components.

    Lack of verification of the origin and integrity of packages and libraries.

    Insecure or poorly tracked build and distribution processes.

    Unauthorized access or poor controls over development tools and environments.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use automated scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.

    Verify digital signatures and checksums to ensure integrity and authenticity.

    Enforce strict access control policies on build and deployment environments.

    Automate and track the entire build process to ensure transparency.

    Regularly update components and monitor official sources for security patches.

    Educate teams and developers on supply chain security best practices.
