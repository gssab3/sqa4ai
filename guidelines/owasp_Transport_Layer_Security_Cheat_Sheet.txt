Introduction

TLS is a fundamental cryptographic protocol that protects communications over unsecured networks, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity between client and server. Its correct implementation is essential to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

What to do / Risk factors

    Use of obsolete or insecure versions of TLS (e.g., SSL, TLS 1.0, 1.1).

    Incorrect configurations that allow the use of weak or insecure ciphers.

    Lack of valid or incorrectly verified certificates.

    Implementations that do not support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

    Failure to manage certificate renewal or revocation.

Solutions and Prevention

    Always configure the most up-to-date versions of TLS (TLS 1.2 or higher).

    Disable weak protocols and ciphers and enable only secure suites.

    Use certificates signed by trusted certificate authorities and implement them correctly.

    Support Perfect Forward Secrecy to protect past sessions in the event of key compromise.

    Monitor and automate certificate management to prevent expiration and revocations.

    Periodically test TLS configuration with security analysis tools.
