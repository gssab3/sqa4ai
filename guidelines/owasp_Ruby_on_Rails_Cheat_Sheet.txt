Introduction

The Ruby on Rails Sheet provides guidance for securing applications developed with the Ruby on Rails framework, addressing the most common vulnerabilities associated with this platform. The goal is to help developers build secure and resilient applications against known attacks.

Causes

    Using outdated or outdated versions of the framework and libraries.

    Suboptimal security configurations, such as insecure sessions or cookie handling.

    Lack of or incorrect protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection.

    Accidental exposure of sensitive data through errors or logs.

Solutions and Prevention

    Keep Ruby on Rails versions and gems up to date.

    Enable built-in protections such as CSRF tokens and Strong Parameters for input validation.

    Use escaping and sanitization techniques to prevent XSS.

    Implement strict authentication and authorization controls.

    Properly configure sessions and cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).

    Properly manage logging and error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information.
