Introduction

The password recovery process is a critical function for user and application security. It must be designed to balance ease of use and abuse prevention, preventing attackers from exploiting the functionality to compromise accounts.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Weak or easily manipulated reset mechanisms (e.g., predictable or non-expired tokens).

    Lack of limits on the number of reset requests, encouraging brute force or denial of service attacks.

    Exposing information about the existence of an account during the process.

    Sending links or tokens that are insecure, unencrypted, or with excessively long expiration times.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use unique, random, and short-expiry tokens for resets.

    Limit reset requests per user and IP to prevent abuse.

    Avoid revealing information about the existence of the account during the process.

    Secure communication with HTTPS and send secure links.

    Log reset events for monitoring and auditing.

    Inform users via email when a reset is required, so they can detect suspicious activity.
