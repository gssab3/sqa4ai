Introduction

LDAP Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unvalidated or malformed input is used in LDAP queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate or bypass access controls. This cheat sheet offers guidelines for preventing LDAP injection by protecting LDAP queries from malicious input.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Lack of validation and sanitization of input used to construct LDAP queries.

    Direct concatenation of user input in unescaped LDAP filters.

    Using dynamic LDAP queries without secure parameters or bindings.

Remediation and Prevention

    Rigorously validate input used in LDAP queries.

    Use LDAP-specific escaping functions to neutralize special characters.

    Prefer the use of parameterized queries or LDAP prepared statements, if supported.

    Restrict the privileges of the account used to execute LDAP queries.

    Monitor and log suspicious LDAP activity.
