Introduction

Virtual patching is a temporary security measure that protects a system from known vulnerabilities without modifying the source code by applying filtering or control rules at the network or application level.

What to do / Risk factors

    Known vulnerabilities not immediately fixed in the code.

    Inability or delay in updating vulnerable software.

    Targeted attacks targeting vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched.

Solutions and prevention

    Implement application firewalls (WAFs) or intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) with specific rules to block known exploits.

    Continuously monitor vulnerabilities and update virtual patching rules.

    Use virtual patching as a temporary measure, aiming for a permanent fix via official patches.

    Thoroughly test rules to avoid false positives or blocking legitimate traffic.
