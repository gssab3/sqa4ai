Introduction

Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is interpreted as code or commands, allowing an attacker to manipulate system execution. This type of vulnerability is among the most common and critical in web applications and software.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Lack of or insufficient validation and sanitization of input data.

    Direct use of user input in SQL queries, system commands, or unprotected scripting languages.

    Dynamic construction of commands or queries without escaping mechanisms or parameters.

    Lack of access controls on critical operations.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.

    Rigorously validate and sanitize all input data, preferably with whitelists.

    Avoid dynamically chaining commands or queries with uncontrolled input.

    Apply the principle of least privilege for database and system access accounts.

    Conduct a security analysis during development and use scanning tools to detect potential injections.
