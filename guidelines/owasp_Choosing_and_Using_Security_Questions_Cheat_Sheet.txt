Introduction

    Security questions are a common method for authenticating or recovering access to accounts, but they are often unsafe if poorly chosen or implemented. This cheat sheet provides guidelines for choosing and using these questions correctly, minimizing the risk of compromise by using easily available or guessable answers.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Questions that are too simple or common, with answers that are easily found online or socially engineerable (e.g., mother's name, hometown).

    Lack of variety in questions, leading to predictable answers.

    Lack of options for customizing questions, forcing insecure choices.

    Poor protection of stored answers, often in plain text or with weak encryption.

    Exclusive use of security questions as the sole recovery mechanism, without backup or multifactor authentication.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Choose questions with answers that are not easily available publicly and that require personal knowledge that is difficult to guess.

    Provide a varied list of questions and allow users to create their own.

    Protect stored answers using hashing and salting techniques, as with passwords.

    Integrate security questions with multifactor authentication methods or more secure alternatives for account recovery.

    Inform users about the associated risks and recommend informed answer choices.

    Periodically monitor and update questions and related security policies.
