Denial of Service Cheat Sheet

Introduction

This cheat sheet provides guidance for preventing and mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are designed to render an application or service unavailable by overloading it with requests or resources. The goal is to ensure operational continuity and infrastructure resilience.

Typical Problems / Causes

    Lack of resource limits or rate limiting on requests.

    Lack of input controls, which can cause heavy processing or infinite loops.

    Monolithic architectures that are unscalable or have obvious bottlenecks.

    Failure to implement network and application-level protections.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Implement rate limiting and throttling to reduce abusive requests.

    Validate inputs to prevent excessively expensive processing.

    Use scalable architectures and load balancers.

    Adopt dedicated WAFs, CDNs, and DDoS mitigation services.

    Monitor traffic and resources to identify abnormal spikes and respond promptly.
