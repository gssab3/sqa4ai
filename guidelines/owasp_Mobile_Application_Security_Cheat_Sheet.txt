Mobile Application Security
Introduction

This cheat sheet covers the key security considerations in developing and managing mobile applications. Mobile apps are subject to specific risks related to the mobile environment, access to sensitive data, and interaction with often insecure networks.

Common Causes and Issues

    Insecure storage of sensitive data on the device.

    Unencrypted or weakly protected communications with backend servers.

    Excessive or incorrect permissions granted to the app.

    Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components.

    Reverse engineering attacks or manipulation of app code.

    Lack of integrity checks and strong authentication.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use encrypted storage for sensitive data and limit locally stored data.

    Ensure all network communications are protected with up-to-date TLS.

    Apply the principle of least privilege to app permissions.

    Regularly test and update third-party libraries to avoid known vulnerabilities.

    Integrate integrity checks to detect app modifications or tampering.

    Implement robust authentication mechanisms, preferably multifactor.

    Monitor the app for anomalous behavior and runtime attacks.
