Introduction

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security mechanism that forces browsers to communicate exclusively via HTTPS, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle and downgrade attacks.

Typical Causes of Problems

    The absence of HSTS allows attackers to intercept or modify unencrypted HTTP communications.

    Misconfigurations or failure to include the main domain and subdomains can leave vulnerabilities open.

    Insufficient validity periods or failure to include them in the preload list reduce the effectiveness of HSTS.

Solutions and Prevention

    Enable HSTS with an adequate validity period (e.g., at least 6 months or more).

    Include the includeSubDomains option to extend protection to all subdomains.

    Register the domain in the HSTS preload list to ensure immediate policy enforcement by browsers.

    Test the configuration to avoid accessibility issues or redirect loops.
