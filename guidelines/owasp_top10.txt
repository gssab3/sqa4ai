The 10 most significant software security risks are as follows (in no particular order):

1. Broken Access Control
All information should be available only to a specific group of users based on their granted privilege level.
Broken access control can lead to scenarios where users can access information they shouldn't have.
For example, if any user can access the admin page even if they are not an administrator, their role has not been properly validated. This security risk can be mitigated by implementing an access control system based on record ownership.

2. Cryptographic Failures
Formerly known as Sensitive Data Exposure, these focus on cryptographic failures.
Rather than directly attacking a system, hackers often try to steal data while it is in transit from the user's browser.
To prevent such attacks, it is necessary to create a secure communication channel. For web-based applications, a quick solution to this problem is to apply TLS on all pages.
Without it, a hacker can monitor network traffic, downgrade the connection from HTTPS to HTTP, and capture all information passed in clear text: user data, passwords, session cookies, etc.

3. Injection
Injection includes SQL injection, OS command injection, LDAP injection, and code injection.
Injections are a category of security vulnerabilities that occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter as part of a command or query. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute unauthorized commands or access unauthorized data. Here's an explanation of each of the injections mentioned and how to prevent them:
SQL Injection: Occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious SQL code into a query. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the database, access sensitive data, modify, or delete data. To prevent this, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, validate and sanitize all user input, and use the principle of least privilege to limit database access.
OS Command Injection: Occurs when an application passes untrusted input to an operating system command interpreter. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system. To prevent this, avoid using functions that execute system commands with untrusted input, validate and sanitize all user input, and use secure libraries that restrict the execution of system commands.
LDAP Injection: Occurs when an application constructs Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries using untrusted input. This can allow an attacker to manipulate LDAP queries to access unauthorized information. To prevent this, use parameterized LDAP queries, validate and sanitize all user input, and limit access privileges to the LDAP server.
Code Injection: Occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious code into an application that is then executed by the application itself. This can include code injection into scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Python, etc. To prevent this, it is necessary to validate and sanitize all user input, use sandboxes to execute trusted code, and limit code execution privileges.

4. Insecure Design
An insecure application design refers to a structure that inherently lacks any security controls and lacks effective code writing. A factor that contributes to the recurrence of this security issue is the complete lack of a risk profile for the business or the system being developed.

5. Security Misconfiguration
Attackers are aware of security vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited at a technical level. Most attacks and breaches are made possible by incorrect or obsolete configurations. Examples include unnecessary open network ports, accounts with default login credentials, and errors that return information about the application (which requires patching to remove unnecessary functionality, unused files, and unnecessary code).

6. Vulnerable and Obsolete Components
This is probably the most complex vulnerability to analyze and detect, yet it is a problem known to the entire global IT community. For this reason, developers are advised against developing code based on components that are already vulnerable and obsolete. There are automated tools that alert you when a more recent update to a component is available.

7. Identification and Authentication Errors
Also known as Broken Authentication, this error refers to an authentication process that fails to confirm the user's identity. In this case, the attacker gains access and impersonates another user.

Any type of attack that exploits this vulnerability includes credential stuffing, for example.

8. Data Integrity Errors
This refers specifically to security flaws that do not protect against integrity breaches. The most common situation is caused by the presence of outdated plug-ins, libraries, and modules from untrusted sources.

9. Logging and Security Monitoring Failures
This is a security flaw found when systems lack incident response processes.

10. Server-Side Request Forgery
Server-side request forgery refers to data that shows a relatively low incidence rate but has above-average scores for exploits and impact potential.
