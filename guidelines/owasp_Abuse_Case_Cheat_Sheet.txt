Introduction
Abuse cases describe scenarios in which a system can be misused or used maliciously, going beyond normal use cases. Security requirements often contain vague phrases such as “The system must be secure,” but without precisely defining which abuses are to be prevented. Identifying abuse cases allows you to specify concrete risks and targeted requirements to counter harmful actions, improving overall security.

Common causes of the problem

    Lack of detailed analysis of attack methods or misuse of the system.

    Security requirements that are too generic and unmeasurable.

    Absence of scenarios representing malicious intentions or abnormal behavior by users or attackers.

    Failure to consider possible deviations from expected behavior during design.

Solutions and prevention

    Define specific abuse cases, i.e., detailed descriptions of possible misuse of the system.

    Integrate abuse cases into the requirements gathering process to translate concrete risks into precise and verifiable requirements.

    Use abuse cases as a basis for designing targeted security controls, tests, and validations.

-   Keep abuse cases up to date during development as new threats or scenarios emerge.
