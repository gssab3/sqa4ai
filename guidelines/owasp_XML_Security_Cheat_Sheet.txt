Introduction

XML security protects applications that process XML data from specific attacks such as XXE, XPath Injection, and Denial of Service, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

What to do / Risk factors

    Improperly configured XML parsers vulnerable to XXE and XPath Injection.

    Lack of XML input validation and sanitization.

    Use of XML documents from untrusted sources.

    Incorrect configurations that allow access to internal resources or modification of sensitive data.

Solutions and prevention

    Disable dangerous features such as external entities and DTDs (Document Type Definitions).

    Validate, sanitize, and limit the size of incoming XML documents.

    Use up-to-date and secure XML parsers.

    Monitor and log XML requests.
