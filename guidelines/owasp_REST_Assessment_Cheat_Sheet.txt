Introduction

The REST Assessment is a security assessment of RESTful APIs, focusing on identifying risks, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses in these communication architectures. It ensures that REST APIs are designed and implemented following security best practices.

Causes

    Lack of adequate authentication and authorization on APIs.

    Excessive exposure of unnecessary endpoints or data.

    Lack of validation and sanitization of inputs received via APIs.

    Incorrect or insecure configurations of API servers.

Solutions and Prevention

    Conduct regular audits and penetration tests specific to REST APIs.

    Rigorously control authentication and authorization on each endpoint.

    Minimize surface attacks by limiting exposed endpoints and data.

    Use secure protocols (HTTPS) and rate limiting to mitigate attacks.

    Enforce thorough validation and sanitization of inputs.

    Clearly document APIs and access limits.
