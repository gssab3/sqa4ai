Introduction

This cheat sheet focuses on security when using npm, the most widely used package manager for JavaScript/Node.js, highlighting risks related to dependencies, supply chain, and package management.

Causes and Issues

    Use of unsafe or compromised packages containing malware or malicious code.

    Dependencies with known or outdated vulnerabilities.

    Possibility of supply chain attacks (e.g., "typosquatting" packages or malicious packages being published).

    Lack of verification of package provenance and integrity.

    Misconfigurations in project files that can expose sensitive data.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use packages from trusted sources and verify their authoritativeness.

    Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities using automated tools (e.g., npm audit).

    Use scanning tools to check the security and integrity of dependencies.

    Avoid including sensitive or secret files in packages or public repositories.

    Correctly configure the package.json file to limit risks and reduce the attack surface.

    Educate developers on supply chain risk and npm best practices.
