Introduction

The REST Security Cheat Sheet provides guidelines for designing and implementing secure REST APIs, ensuring that communications and resources are protected from common attacks and specific vulnerabilities.

Causes

    Lack of or incorrect authentication and session management.

    Lack of granular authorization and access control.

    Vulnerabilities related to unvalidated input, such as injection and XSS.

    Communications that are unencrypted or exposed to interception.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement strong authentication (OAuth, JWT, API Keys).

    Enforce resource- and action-level authorization.

    Use HTTPS for all communications.

    Validate, sanitize, and parameterize all inputs.

    Set rate limits and monitoring of API calls.

    Properly handle errors and logs without exposing sensitive data.
