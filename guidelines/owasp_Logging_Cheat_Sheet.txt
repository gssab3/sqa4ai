Introduction

Logging is essential for tracking events, errors, and security activities in a system. Good logging management helps detect incidents, diagnose problems, and ensure compliance. This cheat sheet outlines best practices for designing and implementing a secure and effective logging system.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Incomplete or missing logs that prevent event reconstruction.

    Excessive logging that can expose sensitive data or generate overhead.

    Failure to protect logs from unauthorized access or modification.

    Lack of correlation between log events for incident analysis.

    Use of inconsistent or non-standard formats.

Solutions and Prevention

    Clearly define which events should be logged (authentication, errors, logins, etc.).

    Avoid logging sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or unnecessary personal data.

    Protect logs through encryption, access control, and integrity (e.g., checksums).

    Use standardized log formats (e.g., JSON, Common Event Format).

    Implement log rotation, archiving, and lifecycle management.

    Integrate log-based monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies.

    Correlate events across multiple systems for a comprehensive view of incidents.
