Introduction

Bean Validation is a specification that defines a framework for automatically validating Java objects (beans) using annotations. It ensures that data is correct, consistent, and compliant with constraints before being processed or stored, preventing problems such as malicious input, corrupted data, or inconsistent application states.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Insufficient or inconsistent validation on input data.

    Lack of validation on critical fields, causing integrity or security issues.

    Duplicate or scattered validations, difficult to maintain and update.

    Lack of validation on data from untrusted or external sources.

    Poor handling of validation errors, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Use Bean Validation annotations to define clear and centralized constraints on classes and fields.

    Apply validation on both the client and server sides for double-checking.

    Always validate data from external inputs before any processing or storage.

    Properly handle validation errors, providing clear messages and preventing the processing of invalid data.

    Integrate Bean Validation into the application lifecycle and development frameworks used (e.g., Spring, Jakarta EE).

    Regularly test the correctness of validation constraints, including edge cases and malicious inputs.

    Maintain up-to-date constraint documentation to facilitate maintenance and development.
