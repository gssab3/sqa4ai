Introduction

Automating authorization tests is essential to ensure that access control systems function properly and are robust against unauthorized access attempts. Automating these tests allows you to quickly identify authorization issues during development and throughout the software lifecycle, improving the overall security of the application.

Typical Problems and Causes

    Lack of authorization test coverage, with edge cases and incorrect permissions going undetected.

    Manual testing is too expensive and prone to errors or omissions.

    Difficulty in systematically simulating users with different roles and privileges.

    Tests that do not reflect real-world attack or request manipulation scenarios.

    Lack of continuous integration of authorization tests into the development process.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Use automated testing frameworks that support simulating users with different roles and permissions.

    Integrate authorization tests into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to detect regressions early.

    Define clear and comprehensive test cases that cover all critical features and access levels.

    Automate permission verification at both the user interface and API levels.

    Apply fuzz testing and automated penetration testing techniques to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.

    Record and analyze test results to continuously improve coverage and effectiveness.

    Work with security and development teams to update tests based on new threats and system changes.
