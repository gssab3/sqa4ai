Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON, commonly used for authentication and authorization in Java applications. This cheat sheet guides the secure implementation of JWT in Java, covering token creation, signing, verification, and lifecycle management.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Use of weak or inadequate signature algorithms (e.g., none or HS256 with insufficient keys).

    Failure to verify the token signature or its parameters.

    Improper management of token expiration and renewal.

    Exposure of sensitive information within the unencrypted payload.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use strong signature algorithms such as RS256 with private/public keys.

    Always verify the signature and essential parameters (issuer, audience, expiration).

    Set a short token lifetime and use refresh tokens for secure renewals.

    Do not store sensitive data in the clear in the payload.

    Handle token revocation and invalidation correctly.

    Use reliable and maintained Java libraries for JWT manipulation.
