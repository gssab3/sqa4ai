Introduction

This cheat sheet explains the importance and implementation of multifactor authentication (MFA) systems to improve login security, reducing the risk of compromise resulting from weak or stolen passwords.

Causes and Issues

    Exclusive reliance on passwords vulnerable to phishing, brute force, or reuse.

    Unauthorized access to critical systems due to compromised credentials.

    Difficulty implementing MFA without degrading the user experience.

    Lack of support for or integration of MFA in legacy applications.

Solutions and Prevention

    Integrate at least two independent factors for authentication: something the user knows (password), has (token, smartphone), or is (biometrics).

    Prefer phishing-resistant MFA methods, such as authenticator apps or hardware keys.

    Offer flexible user options, balancing security and usability.

    Implement MFA for all critical features and data, especially for remote or privileged access.

    Educate users on the importance and proper use of multifactor authentication.

    Regularly monitor and update MFA technologies and policies to maintain effectiveness.
