Introduction

Protecting user privacy is essential to ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR) and maintain trust. It involves the proper management, collection, storage, and use of personal data, minimizing exposure to the risk of breaches and abuse.

What to do / Risk factors

    Excessive or unnecessary collection of personal data.

    Storage of sensitive data without adequate protection.

    Lack of informed consent or transparency regarding processing methods.

    Accidental or intentional exposure of data to unauthorized third parties.

    Lack of access controls and auditing of personal data.

Solutions and prevention

    Apply the principle of data minimization (collect only necessary data).

    Implement explicit consent and transparency policies for users.

    Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

    Define clear roles and permissions for access to personal data.

    Implement auditing and monitoring systems to detect unauthorized access.

    Provide anonymization or pseudonymization mechanisms where possible.
