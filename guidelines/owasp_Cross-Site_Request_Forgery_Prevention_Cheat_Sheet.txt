Introduction

A CSRF attack tricks an authenticated browser into sending unwanted requests to an application, exploiting the site's trust in the user's identity. This can lead to unauthorized operations (e.g., changing a password, purchasing a product, or elevating privileges).

Typical Problems / Causes

    Browsers that automatically send session cookies, making legitimate requests indistinguishable from forged ones.

    If the application relies only on cookies for authentication, it is vulnerable to CSRF.

What to do / How to prevent

    Check whether the framework used offers built-in CSRF protection; prefer them.

    Implement the Synchronizer Token Pattern: generate a unique token, send it to forms, and validate it for each request.

Alternatives:

    Double Submit Cookie: insert the token in both the cookie and the hidden field of the form and verify the match.

    Cookie-to-Header Token: the JavaScript client reads the token from the cookie and sends it in a custom header.

    Add the SameSite attribute to cookies (e.g., Strict or Lax) to limit sending in cross-site contexts.

    Avoid using GET methods for state-changing operations; always use CSRF tokens for sensitive requests.
