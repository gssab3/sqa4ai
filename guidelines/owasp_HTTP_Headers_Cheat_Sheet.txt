Introduction

HTTP headers are essential components of web communications, allowing control information to be transmitted between client and server. Properly configuring security headers is crucial to protecting applications from multiple types of attacks.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Missing or incorrectly configuring security headers leaves the door open to exploits such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and other client-side vulnerabilities.

    Missing headers or headers with insecure default values can allow data theft or unauthorized manipulation of HTTP responses.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement fundamental security headers such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS).

    Customize and regularly update header values based on specific needs and application context.

    Monitor configuration effectiveness through security tests and automated scanning tools.
