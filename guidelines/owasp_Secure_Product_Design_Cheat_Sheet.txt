Introduction

Secure product design focuses on integrating security from the earliest stages of development, ensuring that the product is built to prevent vulnerabilities and resist attacks throughout its lifecycle.

Causes

    Failure to consider security in the early design stages.

    Poorly defined security requirements.

    Use of vulnerable components or libraries without controls.

    Lack of continuous security review and testing processes.

Solutions and Prevention

    Integrate security as a functional requirement from the beginning.

    Apply threat modeling to identify risks and countermeasures.

    Adopt secure development practices, such as dependency management and code reviews.

    Implement automated and manual security testing throughout the lifecycle.

    Promote security training and awareness within the development team.
