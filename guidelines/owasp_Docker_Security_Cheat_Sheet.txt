Introduction

This cheat sheet provides guidelines for improving the security of containerized applications with Docker. Because Docker isolates processes and environments, it is essential to properly manage images, containers, and the execution environment to prevent attacks and compromises.

Typical Issues / Causes

    Using unverified Docker images or those with known vulnerabilities.

    Running containers with elevated privileges or as root, increasing the risk of escalation.

    Network misconfigurations that expose sensitive services.

    Failure to manage credentials and secrets within containers.

    Lack of regular updates to Docker images and runtimes.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Use official or verified images, preferably minimal and up-to-date.

    Limit container privileges, avoiding running processes as root.

    Apply restrictive network policies and segment containers.

    Manage secrets and credentials securely, for example, with Docker secrets or external tools.

    Regularly update the Docker engine, images, and containers.

    Monitor for suspicious activity and configure logs correctly.

    Apply integrity checks and signatures for Docker images.
