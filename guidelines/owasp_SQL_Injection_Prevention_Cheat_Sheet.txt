Introduction

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by sending malicious input, thus compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of stored data. It is one of the most critical vulnerabilities for web applications that interact with relational databases.

Causes

    Direct insertion of unsanitized user input into SQL queries.

    Failure to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

    Lack of input validation and filtering.

    Legacy code that concatenates strings to construct queries.

Solutions and Prevention

    Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) with parameter binding.

    Validate and sanitize user input based on the context of use.

    Limit database privileges assigned to the application.

    Use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that natively prevent injection.

    Apply logging and monitoring controls to detect suspicious activity.
