Introduction

Laravel is a popular PHP framework for web application development. Security in Laravel covers a variety of aspects, from authentication management to protection against common vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and more. This cheat sheet provides best practices for leveraging Laravel's built-in security features and reducing risks.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Failure to validate and sanitize user input.

    Inadequate session and CSRF token handling.

    Incorrect or missing escaping in Blade templates.

    Incorrect or missing security configurations (e.g., active debugging in production).

    Weak password and authentication policy management.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use Laravel's native validation system for all input.

    Enable and protect CSRF tokens for all POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

    Use Blade's automatic escaping to prevent XSS.

    Disable debug mode in production environments.

    Configure robust password policies (e.g., minimum length, hashing with bcrypt).

    Implement authorizations using Laravel middleware and policies.

    Keep dependencies and the framework up to date.
