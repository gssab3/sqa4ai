Introduction

GraphQL is an API query language that allows flexible client requests. However, its dynamic nature introduces specific risks, such as excessive data exposure, DoS, or injection, which require dedicated controls.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Inadequate permissions at the query level, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

    Complex or malformed queries that can cause slowdowns or denial of service.

    Lack of query validation, exposing the application to injections or other manipulations.

    Lack of rate limiting and request monitoring.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement strict permission control for each query type and field.

    Limit query complexity and request depth.

    Validate and sanitize queries to prevent injections.

    Apply rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and denial of service.

    Log and monitor usage to detect anomalies or attacks.

    Use schema stitching and other methods to isolate and protect sensitive assets.
