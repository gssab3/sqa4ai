Introduction

Security in .NET applications is crucial to protecting data, authenticity, and system integrity. This cheat sheet provides specific guidelines and best practices for secure development in a .NET environment, covering aspects such as identity management, data protection, secure configurations, and prevention of common vulnerabilities.

Typical Causes of Vulnerabilities

    Incorrect management of authentication and authorization, leading to unauthorized access.

    Improper use or lack of encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

    Weak or default security configurations (e.g., incorrect management of certificates, sessions, or permissions).

    Common vulnerabilities such as injection, cross-site scripting, and unpatched vulnerabilities in the framework itself.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement authentication and authorization using built-in .NET mechanisms (e.g., ASP.NET Identity).

    Use strong cryptography to protect sensitive data, including passwords, keys, and data in transit (SSL/TLS).

    Apply least privilege principles for users, roles, and services.

    Keep .NET libraries and frameworks up to date, applying security patches regularly.

    Use input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injections.

    Properly configure security options, such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), Content Security Policy, and session management.
