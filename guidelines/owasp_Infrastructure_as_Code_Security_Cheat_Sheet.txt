Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that allows you to define and manage IT infrastructure through automated configuration files. This methodology improves efficiency and repeatability, but it also introduces security risks if not managed properly, as errors or insecure configurations can quickly propagate throughout the environment.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Misconfigured or unreviewed IaC code that exposes sensitive resources, such as servers or databases, to unauthorized access.

    Use of hard-coded credentials or lack of secure management of keys and secrets within configuration files.

    Lack of change control, lack of auditing, and lack of configuration testing before deployment.

    Dependence on insecure or outdated modules or components.

Solutions and Prevention

    Apply code management best practices, including versioning, review, and automated testing (e.g., through CI/CD pipelines).

    Implement static scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in IaC files.

    Separate secrets and manage them through secure vaults or dedicated management systems, avoiding embedding them directly in code.

    Limit privileges and adopt the principle of least privilege for resources defined in code.

    Educate the development and operations team on the importance of security in IaC and keep security policies up to date.
