Introduction

Pinning is a security technique that helps prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by forcing an application to trust only a specific set of certificates or public keys during TLS connections.

Causes

    MITM attacks exploit fraudulent or compromised certificates if the client accepts any certificate signed by a trusted authority.

    Excessive reliance on the CA certificate chain without more stringent verification.

    Lack of verification mechanisms to block unexpected certificates.

Solutions and Prevention

    Implement Public Key Pinning (PKP) or certificate pinning in client applications.

    Define and maintain a list of trusted certificate or public key hashes.

    Carefully manage the PIN lifecycle to avoid access issues (e.g., temporary PINs, fallbacks).

    Regularly monitor and update PINs to align with new keys or certificates.

    Thoroughly test the implementation to avoid legitimate blocking.
