Introduction

Attack Surface Analysis is a practical and targeted process that helps developers and security specialists identify, understand, and manage the exposed areas of an application susceptible to external attacks. The goal is to minimize the risks associated with attack surfaces, monitor how they change over time, and apply appropriate protections to defend against vulnerable points.
What to Analyze (Attack Surface Definition)

The attack surface includes:

    All data/command input and output channels from the application.

    The code and defense mechanisms that protect these channels (e.g., authentication, authorization, logging, data validation).

    Sensitive and critical data managed by the application (secrets, keys, personal data, intellectual property).

    The code that ensures the protection of such data (e.g., encryption, auditing, integrity checks).

Typical Issues and Risks

    Excessively large and uncontrolled attack surface, which increases the likelihood of exploits.

    Unmonitored changes to the attack surface that can introduce new risks.

    Lack of developer awareness of critical areas to defend.

    Insufficient or misconfigured protections on entry points and sensitive data.

What to Do / How to Prevent

    Map and document the attack surface: identify all entry/exit points, exposed functionality, and sensitive data.

    Continuously monitor and update the attack surface: every change must be assessed for its potential security impact.

    Apply multiple defenses (defense-in-depth) to critical areas.

    Involve developers and security specialists in continuous monitoring during development and maintenance.

    Focus on protecting sensitive data and access controls.

    Conduct risk analyses and targeted testing on areas identified as most exposed or critical.
