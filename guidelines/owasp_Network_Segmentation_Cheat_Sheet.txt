Introduction

Network segmentation is a security practice that divides a network into smaller subnetworks to limit access and mitigate potential compromises. It serves to minimize the attack surface and protect critical resources by isolating them.

Causes and Problems

    Flat, non-segmented networks allow an attacker to move freely once inside.

    Lack of granular access control between different network zones.

    Incorrect or absent deployment of firewalls and access controls between segments.

    Difficulty monitoring and managing traffic flows between services and users.

Solutions and Prevention

    Dividing the network into logical segments based on functions, risk levels, or data types.

    Implement firewalls and access control systems between network segments.

    Use VLANs, subnetting, and micro-segmentation technologies for fine-grained isolation.

    Apply the principle of least privilege to network traffic and communications between segments.

    Continuously monitor traffic flows to detect anomalies or unauthorized access.

    Integrate segmentation with comprehensive security policies, including authentication and encryption.
