Introduction

With the increased use of drones in civil and industrial settings, the security of these devices has become a priority to prevent attacks that could compromise privacy, integrity, and operational safety. This cheat sheet addresses specific drone security risks and countermeasures, both at the hardware and software levels.

Typical Causes of Vulnerabilities

    Unprotected or easily intercepted communications between the drone and controller, exposing them to spoofing or hijacking.

    Outdated or vulnerable firmware that can be manipulated.

    Lack of authentication between drone components and control systems.

    Unauthorized physical access that allows modification or data theft.

    Lack of adequate monitoring or logging of security events.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use encrypted and authenticated communication protocols between the drone and controller.

    Keep firmware updated and apply security patches promptly.

    Implement strong authentication mechanisms for all components and users.

    Physically protect drones and management systems from unauthorized access.

    Enable detailed logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity.

    Conduct risk analyses specific to the operating environment and implement multi-layered defense measures.
