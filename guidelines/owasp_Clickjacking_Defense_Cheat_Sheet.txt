Introduction

Clickjacking is a malicious technique in which a user is tricked into clicking on obscured or overlaid elements on a web page, performing unintended actions (such as submitting a form or activating sensitive commands). The OWASP document provides practical guidance for protecting web applications from this attack, with a focus on server- and client-side prevention.

Main Risks

    Theft of sensitive information (e.g., personal data, credentials).

    Performance of unauthorized operations on legitimate applications.

    Possible account compromise and transaction manipulation.

Prevention Strategies

    Use the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (frame-ancestors) HTTP headers to prevent pages from being loaded within unauthorized iframes.

    Implement server-side checks to verify the referrer or origin of the request.

    Avoid the use of content that can be loaded in unsafe contexts and minimize elements that can be embedded by third parties.

    For applications that need to be displayed in trusted iframes, configure specific whitelisting rules.
