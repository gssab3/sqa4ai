Introduction

OAuth2 sheet provides guidelines for securely implementing OAuth 2.0, the standard delegated authorization protocol widely used for access and identity management.

Causes and Issues

    Incorrect OAuth flow implementations can lead to token exposure or unauthorized access.

    Lack of state parameter validation in authorization flows, exposing them to CSRF attacks.

    Poor management of token expiration and revocation.

    Transmission of unencrypted tokens or tokens in insecure contexts.

    Use of insecure or unvalidated redirect URIs, allowing malicious redirects.

Solutions and Prevention

    Correctly implement OAuth flows with state parameter validation for CSRF protection.

    Use HTTPS for all communications containing tokens and sensitive data.

    Limit token lifetime and privileges by implementing revocation mechanisms.

    Rigorously validate accepted redirect URIs.

    Monitor token use to detect any anomalies or abuse.

    Follow official OAuth 2.0 best practices and stay updated on known vulnerabilities.
