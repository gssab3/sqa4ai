Introduction

Error handling is essential for maintaining the stability, security, and reliability of an application. Proper error handling prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to end users or potential attackers and allows for effective control of anomalous events.

Typical Causes of Problems

    Error messages that are too detailed or contain sensitive information (e.g., stack trace, internal data).

    Lack of appropriate logging that prevents error tracking.

    Inadequate error handling that leads to crashes or unexpected behavior.

    Exposing vulnerabilities through unhandled errors (e.g., disclosure of configuration details).

Solutions and Prevention

    Provide generic error messages to users, keeping technical details only in internal logs.

    Implement a centralized and secure logging system to track errors and anomalies.

    Handle all possible exceptions to prevent crashes or vulnerabilities.

    Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent errors resulting from incorrect data.

    Test system robustness with error simulations and edge cases.
