Introduction

Secure PHP configuration is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities resulting from default or incorrect settings. This cheat sheet guides developers and administrators through configuring PHP to reduce security risks.

Causes

    Permissive default configurations that allow risky operations (e.g., remote code execution, displaying sensitive errors).

    Enabling dangerous or unnecessary functions (e.g., exec(), shell_exec()).

    Lack of resource or execution time limitations that can lead to DoS.

    Logging sensitive information in logs or errors exposed to users.

Solutions and Prevention

    Disable unnecessary or dangerous PHP functions (disable_functions).

    Disable error display in production (display_errors=Off) and log errors securely.

    Limit file uploads and file types.

    Set limits on memory, execution time, and upload size to prevent resource abuse.

    Correctly configure session management (secure cookies, timeouts, ID regeneration management).

    Update PHP and modules to fix known vulnerabilities.
