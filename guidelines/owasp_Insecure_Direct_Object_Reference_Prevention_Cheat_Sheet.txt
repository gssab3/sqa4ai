Introduction

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) occurs when an application directly exposes objects or resources (e.g., files, database records) via predictable identifiers without adequate authorization controls. This allows an attacker to access or manipulate other people's resources.

    Typical Causes of Problems

    Exposing direct and predictable identifiers (e.g., incremental numeric IDs).

    Lack of or poor authorization verification for resource access.

    Incorrect assumptions about identifier security.

    Using unprotected parameters in URLs or APIs.

Remediation and Prevention

    Implement rigorous authorization controls for every request to access resources.

    Use unpredictable identifiers (e.g., UUIDs or random tokens).

    Do not directly expose references to sensitive objects.

    Log and monitor access to critical resources to detect suspicious activity.

    Regularly test APIs and interfaces for IDOR vulnerabilities.
