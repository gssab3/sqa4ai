Introduction

NodeJS Docker Cheat Sheet addresses security best practices for running Node.js applications within Docker containers, highlighting specific risks associated with this combination and how to mitigate them.

Causes and Issues

    Container misconfigurations that expose sensitive services or data.

    Insecure or out-of-date Docker images containing known vulnerabilities.

    Lack of isolation between containers or excessive privileges assigned to containers.

    Poor management of environment variables, which may contain secrets.

    Vulnerabilities in Node.js code that can be amplified in a containerized environment.

Solutions and Prevention

    Use official Docker images and keep dependencies up to date.

    Restrict container privileges (for example, don't run as root).

    Properly manage and encrypt secrets and environment variables.

    Apply security practices in Node.js code: input validation, error handling, etc.

    Configure Docker networking to isolate containers and minimize exposure.

    Use automated image scanning tools for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
