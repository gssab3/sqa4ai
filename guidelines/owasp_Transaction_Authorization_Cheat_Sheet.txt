Introduction

Transaction Authorization involves the rigorous and secure control of operations involving status changes or financial transactions, ensuring that only authorized users and processes can perform sensitive actions.

What to do / Risk sources

    Insufficient or incorrect authorizations that allow prohibited actions.

    Lack of contextual verification (e.g., multi-factor checks or amount limits).

    Lack of logging and auditing of authorized transactions.

    Vulnerabilities related to sessions and authorization token management.

Solutions and Prevention

    Apply role-based authorization (RBAC) or attribute-based authorization (ABAC) principles.

    Implement authorization controls at the individual transaction level.

    Require confirmations or additional authentication for high-risk actions (multi-factor authentication).

    Log all transactions with sufficient detail for auditing and fraud detection.

    Protect authorization tokens and sessions from theft or manipulation.
