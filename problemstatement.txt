Introduction: UniClass is an open-source digital environment
easily accessible to everyone, capable of meeting every
need.
This application not only improves the experience of university
students, but also simplifies the interactions of
instructors with the system and with the students themselves. UniClass
enables real-time access to information on the
daily lives of students and university staff, such as
viewing class schedules and scheduling
classes, and ensures interoperability between students and
instructors to simplify their interactions and the progress of
courses.
Problem Description: The features offered by current
tools are often too similar and overlap.
For example, to find out whether a classroom is free or occupied, a
student must use multiple different applications on multiple
platforms. Not only are the applications scattered and very
similar, creating confusion for users, but students,
in most cases, find themselves in difficulty due to the
lack of course scheduling: a student
who has to take a second-year course and, immediately after, a third-year
course will be forced to waste too much time searching, which will
become frustrating and repetitive.
This system is aimed primarily at university students
and faculty. Different types of users exist for
interactions with the system or with other users, or
simply for managing the digital resources available on the
platform regarding university organization.

UniClass will not handle financial management,
student enrollment, and administrative management regarding
university staff roles.

Objectives:
- Provide a centralized platform for viewing available classrooms and class schedules.
- Improve campus navigation through detailed maps.

- Ensure communication between students and instructors
- Reduce the time and effort required to find relevant information.
