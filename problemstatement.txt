Introduction: UniClass is an open-source digital environment easily accessible to everyone, capable of meeting every need.
This application not only improves the experience of university students, but also simplifies the interactions of instructors with the system and with the students themselves.
UniClass enables real-time access to information on the daily lives of students and university staff, such as viewing class schedules and scheduling classes, and ensures interoperability between students and instructors to simplify their interactions and the progress of courses.
Problem Description: The features offered by current tools are often too similar and overlap. For example, to find out whether a classroom is free or occupied, a student must use multiple different applications on multiple platforms. Not only are the applications scattered and very similar, creating confusion for users, but students, in most cases, find themselves in difficulty due to the lack of course scheduling: a student who has to take a second-year course and, immediately after, a third-year course will be forced to waste too much time searching, which will become frustrating and repetitive.
This system is aimed primarily at university students and faculty. Different types of users exist for interactions with the system or with other users, or simply for managing the digital resources available on the platform regarding university organization.
UniClass will not handle financial management, student enrollment, and administrative management regarding university staff roles.
